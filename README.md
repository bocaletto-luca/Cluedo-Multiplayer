## 🎮 How to Play  

### **1️⃣ Game Setup**  
🔸 Players choose a **character**.  
🔸 The game randomly selects the **culprit, weapon, and crime scene** (hidden from all players).  
🔸 Each player receives **clue cards**, excluding the secret ones.  

### **2️⃣ Moving Around the Mansion**  
🎲 Players **roll dice** and move between rooms.  
🚪 Entering a room allows a player to **make suggestions**.  

### **3️⃣ Making Suggestions**  
💡 A suggestion consists of:  
🔹 A **suspect**  
🔹 A **weapon**  
🔹 The **room** the player is currently in  

📝 The next player (clockwise) checks their **cards**—if they have one of the suggested items, they **privately reveal it** to the suggesting player.  

### **4️⃣ Deduction & Notes**  
📌 Players track suggestions and revealed cards to **eliminate possibilities**.  
🎯 The objective is to correctly **identify** the secret culprit, weapon, and crime scene.  

### **5️⃣ Making an Accusation**  
⚠️ When confident, a player may make a **final accusation**:  
✔️ If correct – **Victory!** 🎉  
❌ If wrong – The player can no longer **make accusations**, but still **reveal clues** for others.
